# task_planning
16-662 Robot Autonomy Project

Integrated a high-level task planner with low-level motion planners that generate arm motions to execute each
subtask – inspired from Hierarchical Planning in the Now (HPN) algorithm

Applied BFS with precondition fulfillment by postponing subgoals – tested and implemented on HERB robot
in the Personal Robotics Laboratory, CMU – reduced task execution time by 31% w.r.t. the existing planner
